## Usage

This is the Horiseon website that can now be accessbile to anyone. This now helps provide Horiseon with a larger user base then before, while at the same time avoid litgation for not providing accessbility to those with disabilities.

## Changes

I replaced most of the nonsemantic elements in the index.html with more semantic elements.

For example, I have provided defined sections within each part of the website in order to provide the user a brief describption of what is in each part of the site.

Also edited the CSS code by combing related classes who shared the same CSS elements together making it much shorter than before
